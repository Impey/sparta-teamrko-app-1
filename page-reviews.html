      <h2>Horror: <br>
        Hallowen</h2>
      <p>In his brilliant turn-of-the-century documentary The American Nightmare, Adam Simon located John Carpenter’s
        1978 Halloween as the end point of a decade of countercultural horror movies. Starting with George Romero’s
        1968 Night of the Living Dead, Simon unpicked the rebellious socio-political threads of films such as Last
        House on the Left, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Shivers before arriving at the more conservative
        inflections of Carpenter’s ruthlessly efficient modern morality tale.

        A stylishly suspenseful thriller in which teenagers indulging in illicit sex and intoxication are stalked and
        slashed by a relentless killer, Halloween was a funhouse ride with a puritanical narrative edge. (“I didn’t
        mean to put an end to the sexual revolution,” Carpenter laughingly told Simon, “and for that I deeply
        apologise.”) Yet it also had a punky power that inspired a slew of titillating teen-terror slashers. Friday the
        13th may have lifted its gory riffs from Mario Bava’s A Bay of Blood (just as Carpenter looked back to Bob
        Clark’s Black Christmas), but it was Halloween that paved the way for its blockbuster success.
        A string of inferior sequels and reboots followed Carpenter’s low-budget hit, from Rick Rosenthal’s 1981
        Halloween II (written by original screenwriters Carpenter and Debra Hill) to Rob Zombie’s dreary 2007
        “reimagining” and its dispiriting follow-up. Now David Gordon Green, whose career has swerved from Terrence
        Malick-esque indie-hit George Washington to the stoner comedy of Pineapple Express and Your Highness, retreads
        familiar ground with added PTSD.

        Like the 20th-anniversary outing Halloween H20, which effectively overrode instalments four to six (the
        superior Halloween III: Season of the Witch follows an entirely separate narrative), this latest incarnation
        effectively dumps the sequels and simply picks up 40 years after the events of the first film, with
        surprisingly sprightly results.

        Former knife-wielding maniac Michael Myers (James Jude Courtney, with contributions from the original’s
        masked-madman Nick Castle) is now in a mental institution, serving his incarceration in silence. Meanwhile,
        survivor and “final-girl” archetype Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, terrific) is living in a remote
        home-cum-security-compound. Haunted by the murderous spectre of Myers (aka “the shape”), Laurie’s paranoia has
        taken its toll; she’s seen her marriages collapse, become estranged from her daughter, Karen (a sharply cast
        Judy Greer), who was taken away as a child, and now fears for the safety of her teenage granddaughter Allyson
        (Andi Matichak). As Laurie tells the annoying podcasters who show up looking for a story: “I’m a basket case.”
        When Michael escapes during transfer to a maximum security prison (a nod to Halloween 4?), Laurie is hardly
        surprised. “He’s waited for me,” she says. “I’ve waited for him…”</p>

      <h2>Comedy: <br>
        Step Brothers</h2>
      <p>Another unashamedly juvenile comedy from the awe-inspiringly busy Judd Apatow production line: Apatow
        produces, and the director is Adam McKay, who made the very funny Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Will
        Ferrell and John C Reilly play two 40-year-old guys who live with their respective single parents and have
        regressed, horribly, to being 13 (a parable, some would say, for the people who make these movies and those who
        enjoy them). When the boys' long-suffering parents (Richard Jenkins and Mary Steenburgen) happen to meet, fall
        in love at a medical-technology conference and then get married, Ferrell and Reilly have to share a bedroom as
        stepbrothers. There are certainly one or two funny, broad moments, especially when the "boys" get it into their
        heads to convert their beds into bunk beds, and their impersonation of 13-year-olds is scarily accurate. But
        Reilly has always been more actor than comic, and this goofy comedy is a DVD rental only.</p>

      <h2>Action: <BR>
        The Expendables</h2>
      <p>Stallone! Statham! Willis! Li! Lundgren! Rourke! Schwarzenegger! The lineup makes it sound like it's set in
        the world's most macho prostate clinic. Sylvester Stallone has called in some favours and created an
        old-school, pre-Bourne action movie, featuring only pampered beefcakes of a certain age: spiritually located
        Where Eagles Dare to Fumble for Their Reading Glasses. Sly plays Barney Ross, a cigar-smoking tough guy who
        heads up a crew of golden-hearted mercenaries. But wait. If you're a Bruce Willis fan, or an Arnie fan, and
        you're expecting your heroes to have equal screen time with the rest – think again. Willis and Governor
        Schwarzenegger only get the briefest of cameos at the beginning, but their unsuspecting fanbases will pump up
        the box office receipts. He's not called "Sly" for nothing, you know: if it was just a diminutive, he'd be
        "Syl". Anyway, Barney and his compadres are paid to fly in to "Vilena", a Spanish-speaking island somewhere in
        the "Gulf" and topple a military dictatorship, without worrying over much about leaving behind a stable
        infrastructure. Poor old Jet Li is mightily dissed with loads of "Chinese people are short" jokes in this
        lumbering, humourless film, and he never gets to win a single punch-up.</p>
